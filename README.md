## A Gmod Trouble in Terrorist Town Addon

**The better Mute Gun on the market.**

Unlike other addons it mutes on the server so you cannot unmute yourself with console.

You can set a multitude of parameters to customize gameplay / damages / duration / etc.

A very simple and customizable, yet effective Traitor weapon:

- Shooting a player mutes him and deal 1 dmg by default.

- Muted players can only be heard by traitors by default.

- Muted players cannot speak in the text chat.

- Muted players doesn't know they are muted, they can only guess (by looking at their HP).
